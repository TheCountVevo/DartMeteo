# Presentation
DartMeteo is a simple program that use OpenWeather's API. I made this to train myself using API's and HTTP in Dart so it's probably not the pretiest code you ever seen.

# DISCLAIMER
You'll need dart SDK installed to make this work !

# How to use it ?
It's simple !
First :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheCountVevo/DartMeteo.git
cd DartMeteo
```
Now you are in the project folder
Second :
```bash
dart main.dart -c YOURCITY
```
And now, if you writed correctly the city, you should see temperature !
